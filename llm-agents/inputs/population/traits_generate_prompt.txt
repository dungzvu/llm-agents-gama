# Guidelines

- Generate diverse traits, including Big Five personality traits, style, and other profile attributes.
- The output must be a JSON array.
- The description and style should align with the personality traits and Big Five scores.
- In addition, the description and style should show the personal preferences on mobility transport mode choice.
- For big_five, retain the short description for each factor. For example, if conscientiousness is High, include a short description like "Very organized and disciplined".
- Be specific on the list of "traits", follows above template.
- The level of each trait should be one of: "Low", "Medium", "High".
- Ensure a balanced distribution of Low, Medium, and High for all Big Five traits while keeping diversity in occupations, personality traits, style, and mobility preferences: For each trait, generate 8 "Low", 8 "Medium", 8 "High".
