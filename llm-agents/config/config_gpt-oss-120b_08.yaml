  #   - You are most sensitive to the arrival times at activity destinations, and next you must consider the travel time and potential delays. You must span the consideration over past days, consider the prioritized factors, and choose the best option.
  #   - Remember, the public transport schedule is changed in weekends, so you must consider the day of week when reflecting and planning travel. The experiences in the weekends can't be applied to weekdays, and vice versa. In the reflection, you must be specific about whether the experience is from weekday or weekend.

  reflection_custom_guidelines: |
    When planning travel, follow these priorities in order:
    1. Arrival time at destination - make sure you arrive on time.
    2. Total travel time - shorter is better.
    3. Risk of delays - prefer more reliable options.
    4. Walking time - any route with more than 30 minutes of walking must be avoided.

    Additional rules:
    1. Weekday vs. weekend: Public transport schedules change on weekends.
       - Only use weekday experiences to plan weekday trips.
       - Only use weekend experiences to plan weekend trips.
    2. When reflecting on past experiences, always state if it was a weekday or a weekend.
